# Quick Device Testing Guide

## Fastest Method: Direct APK Download

### Option 1: Pre-built APK (Recommended)
I can create a direct APK build for you to download and install:

1. **Request APK Build**: I'll generate a downloadable APK file
2. **Download**: Get the APK directly from the build
3. **Install**: Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" and install APK
4. **Test**: Full CallBunker functionality on your device

### Option 2: Expo Go Testing
1. Install "Expo Go" from Play Store
2. I'll start the Expo development server
3. Scan QR code to test instantly

### Option 3: Direct Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd mobile_app
npm install

# Start Expo development server
npx expo start

# Or build APK locally
npx expo export --platform android
```
