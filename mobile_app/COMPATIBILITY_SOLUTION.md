# CallBunker Mobile - Compatibility Solution

## Issue: SDK Version Mismatch
Your Expo Go app uses SDK 53, but our project uses SDK 49. Upgrading to SDK 53 creates major dependency conflicts.

## Solutions Available:

### Option 1: Web Mobile Testing (RECOMMENDED)
âœ… Test the complete mobile interface at: `/mobile` route
- Full mobile experience in browser
- All CallBunker features working
- No SDK compatibility issues

### Option 2: Expo Development Build (Advanced)
If you need native device testing:
1. Create development build: `npx expo run:android` or `npx expo run:ios`
2. This creates standalone APK that doesn't depend on Expo Go
3. Install directly on device for native testing

### Option 3: Downgrade Expo Go (Not Recommended)
- Download older Expo Go compatible with SDK 49
- Not recommended as it affects other projects

## Current Status:
- Web demo fully functional at `/mobile`
- SDK 49 project restored and stable
- All mobile features working in web interface
- Ready for complete testing experience

## Recommendation:
Use the web mobile demo at `/mobile` for full testing of CallBunker features. This provides the complete mobile experience without SDK compatibility issues.
