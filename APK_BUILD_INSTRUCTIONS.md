# CallBunker APK Build Instructions

## Current Status
I've created a fresh Expo SDK 53 project with all CallBunker features that's compatible with your Expo Go app.

## Two Options for APK Creation:

### Option 1: Test with Expo Go (IMMEDIATE)
The new project at `mobile_app/callbunker-build/` uses SDK 53 and is compatible with your Expo Go app.

**To test immediately:**
```bash
cd mobile_app/callbunker-build
npx expo start --tunnel
```
Then scan the QR code with Expo Go - this will work with your SDK 53 app!

### Option 2: Standalone APK (Requires Account)
To create a standalone APK that can make real phone calls:

**Method A - EAS Build (Cloud):**
1. Create free Expo account: https://expo.dev/signup
2. Login: `npx eas login`
3. Build: `npx eas build --platform android --profile preview`

**Method B - Local Build (Advanced):**
1. Install Android Studio and SDK
2. Setup Android development environment
3. Run: `npx expo run:android`

## What the APK Will Include:
- ✅ Native phone calling capability
- ✅ Google Voice caller ID spoofing
- ✅ Complete CallBunker interface
- ✅ Contact access and messaging
- ✅ All privacy protection features

## Recommendation:
First test with the new SDK 53 project using Expo Go, then create the APK if you want standalone installation.

The SDK 53 version should work perfectly with your current Expo Go app!
