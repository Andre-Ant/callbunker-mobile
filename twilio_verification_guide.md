# Twilio Phone Number Verification Guide

## Quick SMS Fix - Verify Your Phone Number

To get CallBunker SMS working immediately, verify your phone number with Twilio:

### Method 1: Twilio Console (Recommended)
1. **Go to**: https://console.twilio.com
2. **Navigate to**: Phone Numbers → Verified Numbers
3. **Click**: "Add a New Number"
4. **Enter**: +1 508 638-8084
5. **Choose**: "Call me with verification code"
6. **Answer the call** and enter the code
7. **Done!** Your number is now verified

### Method 2: API Verification (Alternative)
I can initiate verification programmatically if you prefer.

### After Verification
1. Go to `/sms-test` in CallBunker
2. Send SMS to +1 508 638-8084
3. You should receive the message immediately!

### What This Fixes
- ✅ Bypasses A2P 10DLC registration requirement
- ✅ Allows immediate SMS delivery to your number
- ✅ Perfect for testing CallBunker privacy protection

### Message You'll Receive
```
From: +1 631 641-7727

```

Your real number (+1 508 638-8084) stays completely hidden from recipients. They only see the CallBunker privacy number.
