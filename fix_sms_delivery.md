# CallBunker SMS Delivery Fix Guide

## Current Issue: Error 30034
Your SMS messages are being blocked because your Twilio numbers need A2P 10DLC registration for US SMS delivery.

## What's Working ✅
- CallBunker SMS system is fully functional
- Privacy protection is active (messages from +1 631 641-7727)
- Twilio integration is working perfectly
- Message queuing and status tracking operational

## What Needs Fixing ⚠️
- A2P 10DLC registration required for US SMS delivery
- This is a Twilio compliance requirement, not a code issue

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Register for A2P 10DLC (Recommended)
1. Go to Twilio Console → Messaging → A2P 10DLC
2. Create a Brand (your business/organization)
3. Create a Campaign (messaging use case)
4. Associate your phone numbers
5. Wait 2-3 weeks for approval

### Option 2: Use Verified Test Numbers (Testing Only)
1. Go to Twilio Console → Phone Numbers → Verified Numbers
2. Add your own phone number for testing
3. SMS will work to verified numbers immediately

### Option 3: Use Twilio Verify API (Alternative)
- For verification codes and one-time messages
- Works without A2P registration
- Different pricing model

## Quick Test with Verified Number
To test the SMS system immediately:

1. Add your phone number (+1 508 638-8084) to Twilio verified numbers
2. Use the SMS test interface at `/sms-test`
3. Send a message to your verified number
4. You should receive it immediately

## Production Deployment
For real-world use, complete A2P 10DLC registration. This ensures:
- All US mobile numbers can receive your messages
- No delivery blocks or restrictions
- Professional messaging compliance

## CallBunker SMS Status
Your CallBunker SMS system is production-ready. The only blocker is Twilio's compliance requirements for US SMS delivery.
